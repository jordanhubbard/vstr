You might want to edit the makefile to put the library and include file
somewhere else. Currently it's set for /usr/lib and /usr/include/local,
respectivly. The manual page automatically tries to go in /usr/man/manl,
you may want to change this as well.

This program has not really been used at all, I'm releasing it 
mainly to get some feedback on it (this is not to say that it doesn't
work, there are no KNOWN bugs..). There are two inconsistancies
in the find and delete commands that might raise some ire, see the
documentation.

You will probably want to edit vstr.h to suit your tastes, read OPERATION
for some more vaguely useful information.

There's also a very crude test driver called examp.c.. It wasn't written,
it just grew.. I include it only so that you may do some rudimentary testing
if you wish to take the easy way out. No documentation, no support, if
it was a child I'd disown it. You figure it out.

Please mail any bugs/flames to me so that I may improve the code (the package,
not examp.c).

I'm also interested in any uses made of it, I haven't figured out
any myself [ :-) ]... This package can be redistributed and used
freely with appropriate credit. I am quite curious about the ways
you may find to use it, any mail/interesting code describing
this would be appreciated.


Future plans include block operations, compaction on the fly, regular
expression searches (currently not included due to the differences
in SysV and 4.2 regex(p) code) and any speedups I can think of.

Suggestions gratefully accepted.
