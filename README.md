# vstr

Following some perverse impulse, I found one of my very first OSS contributions
as part of [comp.sources.unix/volume1](https://ftp.sunet.se/mirror/archive/ftp.sunet.se/pub/usenet/ftp.uu.net/comp.sources.unix/volume1) (first contribution, first volume - that seems nicely symmetrical!) from back in 1985 (!).

I remember writing this code for absolutely no reason other than to see what a simple infinite-length string implementation might look like to write.  I was young then.

[Much] older me now feels oddly compelled to check this into GitHub and make it compile on machines / OSes from the current century.  I have no idea why, but then I also had no idea why I was writing this code at the time (see the legacy README) so this also seems like a symmetrical exercise.  It's all about the symmetry.
